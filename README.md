# GoodweUDPToPvOutput
 A tool to use the local network to query the inverter.
 
 Based on work by msatter on https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_message/67162456#67162456
 
 Works with XS inverters with version numbers v1.52.14 and newer, open a ticket at Goodwe to have them update your inverter if your version is lower.
 It appears that the last dot (.14) is most significant and refers to the ARM program that contains the communication code.
